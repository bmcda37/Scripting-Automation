# BashScripting
These scripts show some of my work with Bash & Python as I work towards enhancing my skill set.

## Adding Users Script:
The purpose of this Bash script is to allow for the admin to enter the username, and password for each new user they are wanting to create on a server. For this example, the new user is added to the group, sftp, and once assigned to that group, assigned permissions which are outlined by the administrator. This script utilizes a function as well as a loop so the admin can enter as many new user accounts as needed until they break the loop. I also am working on the Python version as extra practice as I am tyring to grow my skills in Python as well.
