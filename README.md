# BashScripting

The purpose of this Bash script is to allow for the admin to enter in the username, and password for each new user they are wanting to create on a server. For this example, the new user is added to the group, sftp, and once assigned to that group, assigned permissions whiched are outlined by the administrator. This script utilizes a function as well as a loop so the admin can enter as many new user accounts as needed until they break the loop.
